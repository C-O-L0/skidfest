## ðŸ¤” FAQ

> **What do I do if the cheat stops working?**

Message Mowu#1167 on Discord if the game is updated. Wait until a new commit is pushed.

> **This feature isn't working for me!**

Some features, over time lose functionality due to the devs changing their functions in the game code. The most important features will always be available. 

> **Do you have any other hacks??**

Yes! I do! I have a surviv.io hack. You can check it out [here.](https://github.com/Elspex/surviviopremium)
